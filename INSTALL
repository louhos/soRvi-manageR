2. MacOS

3. Windows 7

	Tested ONLY on 64 bit Windows 7 Ultimate, QGIS installed with the stand-alone 
	installer (http://hub.qgis.org/projects/quantum-gis/wiki/Download#Standalone-Installer-recommended-for-new-users).
  
    * Dependencies
  
		- QGIS (tested with 1.7.3)
		- R (tested with 2.14.0) -> installed separately
		- RPy2 (tested with 2.0.3) -> included in the QGIS stand-alone installer
  
	* Installation
	
	
	* Configuration
		- With recent releases of R both 32 and 64 bit versions of R are installed
		  in R_HOME\bin\i386 and R_HOME\bin\x64. RPy2 does not know how to deal 
		  with these paths so after installing QGIS copy the content of R_HOME\bin\i386
		  to R_HOME\bin if not using a 64 bit build of QGIS(*WARNING* this may break 
		  your current system)
